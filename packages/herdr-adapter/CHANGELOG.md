# @guyghost/swarm-dao-herdr-adapter

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- e536a70: Security hardening for GitHub code scanning alerts (all 31 open alerts resolved).

  **Shell-command construction (12 alerts):** every adapter runner now spawns commands as ARGV via `execFile` — the JS side never builds a shell command line, so prompts, labels, series ids and paths can never be shell-interpreted. `HerdrRunner.exec`, `TmuxRunner.exec` and `SandboxExecRunner` take `argv: readonly string[]`; `buildSandboxCommand` (shell-string builder) is replaced by `buildSandboxArgv` (the anchored command still runs through `sh -c` inside the container, which belongs to the image, not to this process). The tmux pane program remains a deliberate shell program — operator-owned config, single argv element to tmux.

  **Polynomial ReDoS (15 alerts):** all risky regexes rewritten linear — line-oriented section parsing (vote/reasoning extraction, delegation signals, delivery-plan phases and tasks, RICE metrics) with `[ \t]` classes instead of `\s`, no `[\s\S]*?` lookahead alternations; trailing-run trims (`/\n+$/`, `/-+$/`, `/\/+$/`) replaced by linear scans. Behavior preserved, including the echo-shadowing case where the first `## Vote` section carries no vote word.

  **Workflow permissions (2 alerts):** `ci.yml` declares `permissions: contents: read`.

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 3f6f71d: herdr child sessions by default for every multi-agent CLI flow. The new `swarm-dao deliberate <id>` makes every agent vote as a real coding agent in its own herdr child session, `swarm-dao roundtable` does the same for proposal ideas, and `swarm-dao implement <id> [<id>…]` dispatches one herdr child agent per proposal — multiple ids develop in parallel, each in its own execution worktree (requires `execution.isolation`). The CLI process is the parent session that pilots the children; attach with `herdr` to watch any child live. Kind and harvest options default from a new typed `herdr` section in `.dao/config.json` (`kind`, `keepPanes`, `timeoutMs`), overridable via `--kind`, `--keep-panes`, `--timeout-ms`. Also exports `herdrAgentName` from the herdr adapter and widens `ExecutionConfig.isolation` to include `"sandbox"` (already supported by GitWorkspace).

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 58601df: New herdr host: `createHerdrHostAdapter` runs each deliberation agent as a real coding agent inside an isolated herdr workspace (`herdr.dev`) — `workspace create` → `agent start --kind` (pi, claude, codex, grok, opencode, …) → `agent prompt --wait` → `agent read --source recent-unwrapped`, with automatic workspace cleanup unless `keepPanes`. herdr's lifecycle tracking means a blocked agent (approval/question UI) surfaces as an error output, never as a vote; the operator can attach to any agent pane live. Agent ids are sanitized into herdr's `[a-z][a-z0-9_-]{0,31}` name contract, per-call timeouts are honored, and `readFile`/`writeFile` are contained under the working directory. Thirteen unit tests plus a real-server integration suite (error path always; full agent round-trip behind `HERDR_IT=1`).
