Improvement loop everywhere: new `@guyghost/swarm-dao-improvement` executor package (series orchestrator, cycle runner, herdr workers, per-project `.dao/improvement.json` anchor config) and `swarm-dao improve init|status|once|submit` CLI commands to run improvement series in any project. Anchor commands can execute in a bounded sandbox (`--sandbox docker|container|auto|none --image <ref>`: network off, repo mounted at /workspace, CPU/memory caps) via Docker or Apple container. Core gains the `models/improvement` export subpath and the `improve` registry entry.
